# Factors Contributing to Reading Achievement in South Africa: A PIRLS 2021 Analysis

Project Description
This project analyzes factors that contribute to fourth-grade students' reading achievement in South Africa using the PIRLS 2021 dataset.
We explore how socio-economic status (SES), parental involvement, and student reading attitudes influence reading performance.
The study uses exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and multiple regression modeling to explain reading achievement.
 

## Dataset
•	Source: PIRLS 2021 International Database
•	Participants: 9,318 fourth-grade students from South Africa.
•	Variables used:
	    SES (Low, Middle, High)
	    Parental Involvement (Very High, High, Medium, Low, Very Low)
	    Student Reading Attitude (Very Much Like, Somewhat Like, Do Not Like)
	    Outcome Variable: Reading Achievement (continuous score)
